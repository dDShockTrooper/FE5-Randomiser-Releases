# FE5-Randomiser-By-dD_ShockTrooper

Credits to Zane Avernathy's amazing publicly available documentation on FE5 ROM data, Klokinator's original Visual Studio form design, NNadnerd's original FE5 Randomiser source code. All these reference materials saved me countless hours of work when building the project from scratch.

Release for 0.9BETA version of the FE5 Randomiser
There's going to be bugs. If you get a ROM crash, email me the seed used to create the faulty ROM (ddshocktrooper @gmail.com) or drop a message on the discord server. If you get a logic error or have other feedback, describe what you think is the issue and send it.
